# **Engagement Challenge: Digital Banking Transformation**

### **Partner Context**

A regional bank is under pressure to modernize its customer experience and keep pace with competitors. Leadership has asked for a consulting engagement to **launch a mobile-first digital banking app** with embedded **AI chatbot support** and **open banking API integrations** by the end of the year.

### **Consulting Problem Statement**

The bank must balance:

- **Regulatory compliance** (open banking rules not fully finalized).
- **Customer trust** (42% hesitant to share financial data with third-party apps).
- **Technology readiness** (vendor API latency, mainframe data migration risks).
- **Competitive pressure** (other regional banks have already launched AI-driven experiences).
- **Budget constraints** (cloud costs are trending over forecast).

### **Engagement Objectives**

As the consulting team, your goal is to:

1. **Establish governance & reporting structure** (kickoff cadence, RACI, RAID).
2. **Identify and mitigate risks** across compliance, technology, and customer adoption.
3. **Define KPIs & success metrics** (adoption, retention, chatbot resolution, cost efficiency).
4. **Drive execution clarity** by assigning tasks and dependencies to accountable owners.
5. **Communicate outcomes effectively** to partner leadership with executive-ready deliverables.

### **Challenge for the Workshop**

Take the kickoff meeting transcript and:

- Capture structured notes (Cornell, RAID, Action Items).
- Assign tasks & dependencies (Planner-ready JSON, RACI).
- Research external context (Consensus on “customer trust in open banking”).
- Build partner-ready outputs (recap email, RAID diagram, Gamma AI slide deck).
